Algorithm Challenge #15 – Letter Pattern
-
🧮 Problem Description
-
This program reads a positive integer from the user and prints a growing letter pattern using uppercase ASCII characters.
Each row prints one letter repeated based on its alphabetical position.

This challenge strengthens understanding of ASCII manipulation, nested loops, and pattern construction in C++.

💡 What You’ll Learn
-
How ASCII values map to characters

Using nested loops for pattern generation

Writing modular and readable C++ functions

Validating user input

Strengthening foundational algorithmic skills

🧩 Example
-
Input:

Enter a positive number: 5

Output:

A

BB

CCC

DDDD

EEEEE


📂 File Information
-
Language: C++

File Name: letter_pattern.cpp

Challenge Number: #15

💬 Notes
-
Letter-based patterns are excellent for practicing ASCII operations and nested loop logic.
This is a core exercise for reinforcing early algorithmic thinking.
